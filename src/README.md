## Java Algorithm Set

From early 2022 I have been solving algorithm problems to improve my problem-solving skills.
<br/> The joy when all my code passes all the test cases `:blush:`
Initially,solving algorithms with java was taking long time with long lines of code.
I switched to python and I can  say solution to alg-problems were implemented in really short lines 
of codes.

I have come to realization that, in order to improve a career as a java developer, then  
it is much of greater benefits for me to  solve  questions in java even though the python solutions
are more precise and easy to implement.

So, as a consequence i have come back to enjoy the ride of solving algorithm problems in Java.

Packages include solutions of 

1. Leetcode
2. EPI-(Elements of Programming Interviews in Java)
3. Atcoders
4. Personal Study 
5. Code Seoul- Algorithm meet group solutions
