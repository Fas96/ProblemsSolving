## Bitwise Operations (Primitive Types)
A <b>bitwise operation</b> is an operation that operates on bits and performs bit-by-bit manipulation.
The most Commonly used <b>bitwise operations</b> are:

    1. AND  : (a & b) 
    2. OR   : (a | b) : 
    3. XOR  : (a ^ b) : Exclusive OR
    4. NOT  : (~a) : Inverts all the bits
    5. Left Shift : (a << b) :Matheamatically equivalent to a * 2^b
    6. Right Shift:
        1. Arithmetic Right Shift : (a >> b) :Mathematically, a >> b is equivalent to a / 2^b
        2. Logical Right Shift : (a >>> b)  :Mathematically, a >>> b is equivalent to a / 2^b treating a as unsigned

A combination of these basic bitwise operations can be used to perform complex operations. 
Some complex of bitwise operations developed from the basics mentioned above include:

    1. Set a bit at a given position : (a | (1 << b))
    2. Clear a bit at a given position : (a & ~(1 << b))
    3. Toggle a bit at a given position : (a ^ (1 << b))
    4. Check if a bit is set at a given position : ((a & (1 << b)) != 0)
    5. Check if a bit is clear at a given position : ((a & (1 << b)) == 0)
    6. Clear all bits from the most significant bit through i (inclusive) : (a & ((1 << i) - 1))
    7. Clear all bits from i through 0 (inclusive) : (a & (~((1 << (i + 1)) - 1)))
    8. Update a bit at a given position : (a & ~(1 << b)) | (value << b)
    9. Clear the least significant bit : (a & (a - 1))
    10. Isolate the least significant bit : (a & ~(a - 1))
    11. Isolate the rightmost set bit : (a & (-a))
    12. Isolate the rightmost 0 bit : (a | (a + 1))
    13. Isolate the rightmost 1 bit : (a | (a - 1))
