## Top tips for Primitive Types

1. Know bitwise operators,particularly shifting and masking, and how to use them to solve problems (XOR, AND, OR, NOT, left shift, right shift, unsigned right shift, mask, etc.)
2. Know fast ways to clear the lowermost set of bits (and by extension,set the lowest-most 0 , get its index, etc.)
3. Understand the difference between signed and unsigned types, and how to convert between them and its implications to shifting and masking.
4. consider using a cache to accelerate operations by using it to brute-force small inputs
5. Be aware that commutativity and associativity can be used to perform operations in parallel and reorder operations.
