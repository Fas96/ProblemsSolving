You need to know many algorithms (USACO teaches some of the basics which you MUST know).

All kind of sorting algorithms
How to handle bit-operations (See "tips, tricks and tweak")
Complexity of well-known algorithms
Graph (BFS, DFS,...)
Maths (Number Theory)
Geometry (Convex Hull, Interval tree,...)
Greedy algorithm
Dynamic algorithm
others


Graphs (bfs, dfs, flood fill algorithm, shortest path (diskja, floyd), tree, network flow)
Dynamic algorithm, dictionary algorithm
Geometry (need to know at least convex-hull, detect a point is inside a polygon, calculate the area of a polygon, etc.)
Graphs, dynamic, ad-hoc, simulation, maths, geometry + dynamics, graphs + geometry, maths + dynamic, and so on
